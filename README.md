Image super resolution using auto encoders
Here are some links to learn more on autoencoders

The pretrained weights have also been uploaded 
if your try to fit the model without the pretrained weights it will take few hours depending on the GPU as there are over 1 million trainable parameters .

Here is the link to the dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rvEZQxIGIBRKAjfUM1-gG22x7X53dvKL?usp=sharing
